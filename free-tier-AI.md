# Azure Services: Free Tier

It can be difficult to navigate pricing structures for machine learning and artificial intelligence services – especially if you’re only interested in free offerings, after the 30- or 90-day trials end. Below is a detailed listing of Azure free-tier AI and ML services, as of Monday, November 6th, 2017.
